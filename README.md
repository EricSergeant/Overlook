## <a id="#overview">Overview</a>
This one-week project is the final solo challenge in Module 2 of the Turing School of Software and Design Front-End program. THe goal of this project was to build a hotel booking app that demonstrates the use of Object Oriented Programming, APIs to send and receive data, a solid code review process, and robust testing suites to test all functionality.  The app allows users to log in and see past and upcoming bookings, track the total amount they've spent, as well as create new bookings.

## <a id="#challenges-and-wins">Challenges and Wins</a>
This was the first solo project to use fetch to both retrieve data from the API and update the API with information flowing back to it.  It was also challenging to keep track of the various class constructors, the methods of each, and the ways they all interacted with each other.  This was also my introduction to SCSS, which was it's own learning curve.

Overall, I was able to successfully implement the MVP for this project, including the new challenging material such as GET/POST and SCSS.  I was also able to get a fully-tabable page with 100% Lighthouse accesssibility and no ARIA errors/issue.  Using project and issue tracking on GitHub, I was able to keep track of all iterations, user stories, and bugs to successfully complete the project in a very limited amount of time.  

## <a id="#future-additions">Future Additions</a>
- Refactoring: Since this was only a week-long project, there are opportunities for improvement.  Specificaly, I would like to improve the general layout and design of the app.  I would also like to move from `innerHTML` adjustments to using `Node.appendChild()` instead.
- Manager login: Adding a manager login, along with the ability to delete bookings via the API.





# Webpack Starter Kit
Here is a video that walks through some information about [import and export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3oSWwapPKQ). There are a lot of resources out there about `import` and `export`, and resources will sometimes call them `ES6 modules`. It's something you will see in React and beyond.
