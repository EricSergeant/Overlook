## <a id="#overview">Overview</a>
This one-week project is the final solo challenge in Module 2 of the Turing School of Software and Design Front-End program. THe goal of this project was to build a hotel booking app that demonstrates the use of Object Oriented Programming, APIs to send and receive data, a solid code review process, and robust testing suites to test all functionality.  The app allows users to log in and see past and upcoming bookings, track the total amount they've spent, as well as create new bookings.

- Refactoring: Since this was only a week-long project, there are opportunities for improvement.  Specificaly, I would like to improve the general layout and design of the app.  I would also like to move from `innerHTML` adjustments to using `Node.appendChild()` instead.
- Manager login: Adding a manager login, along with the ability to delete bookings via the API.






# Webpack Starter Kit

## Clone This Repo

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text, Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

Here is a video that walks through some information about [import and export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3oSWwapPKQ). There are a lot of resources out there about `import` and `export`, and resources will sometimes call them `ES6 modules`. It's something you will see in React and beyond.
